# GGR472 Lab 2
 
This repository contains code for my webpage with a link to a GeoJSON file and two web maps. 
One map is about Eastern Ontario road trip attractions, and the another is showing TTC subway map in Toronto.

I used the subway stations data from http://ttcdata.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/; 
the subway lines data from https://open.toronto.ca/dataset/ttc-subway-shapefiles/; 
and boundaries of Toronto neighbourhoods from https://open.toronto.ca/dataset/neighbourhoods/.
